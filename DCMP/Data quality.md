## What is Data Quality?
Data quality ensures that data is fit for its intended purpose. Poor data quality can lead to incorrect insights, inefficiencies, and compliance risks.

### Dimensions of Data Quality:
- **Accuracy**: Data must reflect real-world values correctly.
- **Completeness**: No critical data should be missing.
- **Consistency**: Data should align across systems and datasets.
- **Timeliness**: Data must be up-to-date and available when needed.
- **Validity**: Data should comply with required formats or rules.
- **Uniqueness**: No duplicate records should exist.

## Importance of Data Quality
- **Improved Decision-Making**: Reliable data leads to better business insights.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Reduces errors in processes and systems.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensures adherence to standards like GDPR or HIPAA.
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Accurate data enhances customer interactions.
- **Cost Reduction**: Minimizes the costs associated with correcting errors.

## Common Causes of Poor Data Quality
- **Human Error**: Manual data entry mistakes.
- **Integration Issues**: Merging inconsistent data from multiple sources.
- **Outdated Systems**: Legacy systems that donâ€™t enforce data standards.
- **Incomplete Processes**: Lack of proper validation or checks.
- **Data Silos**: Isolated systems that limit access and context.

## Methods to Measure Data Quality
- **Data Profiling**: Analyze datasets to identify issues.
- **Data Auditing**: Regularly review data for compliance and accuracy.
- **Data Quality Metrics**:
  - Percentage of valid records.
  - Percentage of duplicate records.
  - Frequency of data updates.

## Data Quality Management
Effective data quality management involves a systematic approach to monitor and improve data.

### Key Processes:
- **Data Quality Assessment**: Identify and document data quality issues.
- **Data Cleansing**: Correct or remove inaccurate records.
- **Data Standardization**: Enforce consistent formats and definitions.
- **Data Governance**: Establish rules, roles, and responsibilities for maintaining data quality.
- **Monitoring and Reporting**: Continuously track quality metrics and address deviations.
